  InfoText: Simulation Start\nWelcome to our proprietary Vacuum Simulator! With this
    software, you will be controlling one of our vacuum units whereupon once a round
    finishes, the program will replay your actions and you are required to avoid
    them on subsequent simulations.
  objectives:
  - Collect Trash
  - Don't crash into yourself
  - Don't crash into walls
  - Don't let other sims crash into you
